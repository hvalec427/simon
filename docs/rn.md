# React Native dashboard (`simon rn`)

Run and manage a whole React Native project from a single terminal window: start
and drive Metro, boot simulators/emulators, build & run the app on them, forward
Metro's interactive keys (`r`/`d`/`j`…), and watch the JS logs / network / perf —
all at once.

```sh
simon rn init     # register the current directory as a project
simon rn          # open the dashboard for the current project
simon rn config   # print the config file path
```

## Setup

1. From your project root, register it:
   ```sh
   cd ~/dev/my-rn-app
   simon rn init          # adds this project to ~/.config/simon/rn.json
   ```
   `init` detects your package manager and prints the commands it will run, so for
   a standard project you're already done.
2. (Optional) Open the config to customize — `simon rn config` prints its path:
   ```sh
   $EDITOR "$(simon rn config | head -1)"
   ```
   See the [field reference](#field-reference) below. A minimal entry is just a
   `name` and `root`; everything else has a default.
3. From anywhere inside the project, launch the dashboard:
   ```sh
   simon rn
   ```

## Config

Projects live in `~/.config/simon/rn.json`, a registry keyed by repo root. `simon
rn` picks the project whose `root` is a prefix of your current directory, so you
just `cd` into a repo and run `simon rn`.

`simon rn init` scaffolds a minimal entry; everything else falls back to sensible
defaults derived from your package manager (detected from the lockfile). A full
entry looks like:

```jsonc
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "MyApp",
      "root": "/Users/me/dev/myapp",      // matched as a prefix of the cwd
      "packageManager": "yarn",           // optional; npm | yarn | pnpm (auto-detected)
      "metro":   { "command": "yarn start", "port": 8081 },
      "ios":     { "command": "yarn ios", "bundleId": "com.myapp" },
      "android": { "command": "yarn android", "bundleId": "com.myapp" },
      "deeplinks": [                       // optional; the `l` quick-picker
        "myapp://home",
        { "name": "Order 42", "url": "myapp://orders/42" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Anything omitted is derived:

| Package manager | metro | ios | android |
|---|---|---|---|
| npm | `npm start` | `npm run ios` | `npm run android` |
| yarn | `yarn start` | `yarn ios` | `yarn android` |
| pnpm | `pnpm start` | `pnpm ios` | `pnpm android` |

**Port in one place.** Set `metro.port` and nothing else — simon connects its log
feed to that port *and* exports it as `RCT_METRO_PORT` into every command it runs,
so Metro and your builds use the same port. It defaults to `8081`.

**Which device?** You don't pin a simulator/emulator in config — you pick one live
from the dashboard's Devices pane (select + `b` to boot). `i` / `a` just run the
build command against whatever's booted.

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | — | Display name for the project. |
| `root` | yes | — | Absolute repo path; simon picks the project whose `root` is a prefix of your cwd (longest match wins). `rn init` stores the canonical path. |
| `packageManager` | no | auto | `npm` \| `yarn` \| `pnpm`; detected from the lockfile when omitted. Drives the default commands. |
| `metro.command` | no | `<pm> start` | Command to start Metro. |
| `metro.port` | no | `8081` | Metro port. Used for the log feed **and** exported as `RCT_METRO_PORT` to every command — set it only here. |
| `ios.command` | no | `<pm> run ios` / `<pm> ios` | Build & run command for iOS. |
| `ios.bundleId` | no | — | App bundle id; when set, `o` delivers the link straight to the app on a **physical** iPhone instead of Safari. |
| `android.command` | no | `<pm> run android` / `<pm> android` | Build & run command for Android. |
| `android.bundleId` | no | — | Application id; when set, `o` routes the link to that package instead of a browser/chooser. |
| `deeplinks` | no | `[]` | Links for the `l` quick-picker — each a URL string or `{ "name", "url" }`. |

Only `name` and `root` are mandatory — and `rn init` fills both in for you.

## The dashboard

Three tiled panes plus a status bar:

- **Processes** — Metro and each install/run, one sub-tab each, shown as a live
  terminal (colors and Metro's interactive menu render faithfully).
- **Devices & Actions** — every installed simulator/emulator and connected
  physical device, with a running marker. On **Android**, when `android.bundleId`
  is set, each running device also shows whether the app is installed (`app✓`/
  `app✗`) and whether it's in the foreground (`▶fg`). (iOS can't report these over
  the available tooling, so they're Android-only.)
- **JS Logs / Network / Perf** — the full `logs --rn` viewer embedded (see
  [logs](logs.md) for its keys).

### Keys

Each pane owns its own keys (shown in that pane's footer); only a few are global.

**Global** (status bar):

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `⇥` / `⇧⇥` | move focus between panes |
| `Ctrl`+`←→↑↓` | resize the panes (horizontal / vertical split) |
| `R` / `D` | send Metro reload / dev-menu (goes to the Metro process) |
| `q` / `Ctrl-C` | quit — asks `y/n` first, then stops the processes simon started |

**Processes pane:**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `[` / `]` | switch sub-tab (Metro / iOS / Android) |
| `⏎` | enter **input mode** — raw keys go to the process (then `esc` to leave) |
| `x` | stop (kill) the process in the current tab |
| `m` | start (or restart) Metro |

**Devices pane:**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑↓` / `jk` | select a device |
| `⏎` | install & run the app on it (iOS or Android inferred from the device; an offline sim/emulator is launched first) |
| `b` / `s` | start (boot) / stop (shut down) the selected simulator or emulator |
| `o` | launch the app on the device by its `bundleId` |
| `l` | pop up the `deeplinks` picker; press the number/letter beside a link to open it on the device |

Each pane's keys show in its own footer, and only the focused pane's footer is lit
— the others go dark so there's no clutter.

**Driving Metro.** Focus the Processes pane, press `⏎`, and every key goes
straight to Metro — exactly like a normal terminal, so `r`, `d`, `j` and anything
else Metro supports work. `esc` returns to navigation, so you're never trapped.
Don't want to switch panes? `R` / `D` send reload / dev-menu from anywhere (`R`
falls back to a CDP reload when Metro isn't running under simon).

> **Dev-only, macOS.** The JS feed needs Metro running; booting simulators and
> the app-presence checks use the same `xcrun`/`adb` tooling as the rest of simon.
> Foreground detection is Android-only; iOS can't report it over these tools.
